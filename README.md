## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
  -Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I had to revisit Javascript once again, This has actually been one of my first Javascript project without a tutor.
I checked out how to interact with the DOM and some other concepts.

### Continued development

I have to keep on practicing more on vanilla Javascript because I am still not comfortable with it. I also need to work more on CSS before jumping into any framework.

### Useful resources

- [w3 schools] - This helped me get reference materials for several concepts I did not understand well.
- [MDN docs] - I would rush here to find deeper explanation to what was not clear in other documentations. I also read several blogs on medium just to get me started with Javascript.
